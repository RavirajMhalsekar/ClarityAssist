/*
  This file will contain the styles for your popup.html.
  You will likely want to:
  1. Set up Tailwind CSS (or another CSS solution) to process your React components
     and output the compiled CSS here. This would involve configuring your chosen
     build tool (Webpack, Parcel, Vite) to handle CSS.
  2. Manually copy and adapt styles from src/app/globals.css if you need a quicker,
     less integrated approach.

  For a proper setup, integrate Tailwind CSS into your extension's build process.
  The theme variables (CSS custom properties for colors, radius, etc.)
  from your current globals.css are essential for shadcn/ui components to look correct.
  You'll need to ensure these variables are defined and available to popup.html.

  Example of what you might need from globals.css (Tailwind will generate this):
*/

/*
body {
  --background: hsl(230 50% 94%);
  --foreground: hsl(235 61% 30%);
  background-color: var(--background);
  color: var(--foreground);
  /* ... and all other theme variables ... */
}

/*
  You'll also need styles for all the shadcn/ui components.
  The best approach is to have Tailwind process your components and generate
  the necessary utility classes and component styles.
*/
