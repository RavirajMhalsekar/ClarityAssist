/*
  This CSS file is injected into web pages by the content script (content.js).
  You can define baseline styles or overrides here that your content.js might toggle or modify.

  For example, if you have specific classes for highlighted links or custom focus indicators
  that are applied by JavaScript in content.js, you can define those classes here.
*/

/*
  It's generally better to apply styles dynamically via JavaScript (content.js)
  by setting style properties on document.documentElement or body, or by adding/removing classes.
  This allows for more precise control based on user settings.

  However, if you have some static CSS overrides that should always apply when the extension
  is active on a page, you could put them here.

  Example (Conceptual):
  body {
    --user-font-size: 16px;
    font-size: var(--user-font-size) !important;
  }

  .clarity-enhanced-focus:focus {
    outline: 3px solid orange !important;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px orange !important;
  }
*/

/*
  The primary method for applying styles in this setup will be through
  JavaScript in content.js, manipulating CSS Custom Properties on :root or body,
  or directly setting element.style properties.
  The style tag injected by content.js is a more common pattern for dynamic global styles.
