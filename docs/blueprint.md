## Core Features:

- Accessibility Profiles: Enable pre-defined accessibility profiles like Motor Impaired, Blind, Color Blind, Low Vision, Seizure & Learning, and Elderly. These profiles adjust settings according to common needs of each category. Profiles include keyboard navigation, voice control, screen reader support, audio feedback, contrast adjustments, color filters, text resizing, reduced flashing, and simplified navigation.
- Custom Adjustments: Customize accessibility settings including font sizing, letter spacing, word spacing, line spacing, color saturation, contrast, inverting colors, and dark/light mode. Each setting uses a range selector with plus and minus buttons for precise adjustment.
- Tabbed UI: Tabbed interface with 'Accessibility Profiles' and 'Customize' tabs for easy navigation between preset profiles and manual adjustments.
- Profile Toggles: Toggle switches to enable or disable pre-set profiles in the 'Accessibility Profiles' tab.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and reliability. The blue alludes to concepts of clarity, focus and perception.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E8EAF6) to ensure readability and minimize distractions. This hue is visibly related to the deep blue primary.
- Accent color: A vibrant orange (#FF9800) for interactive elements such as toggle switches and range selectors. The orange helps call attention to UI controls in order to reinforce ease of use.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif offering both a modern look and a little warmth.
- Clean, simple UI layout with two tabs: 'Accessibility Profiles' and 'Customize'.  Each profile setting clearly labeled, placed in proximity to its control element, for ease of navigation
- Simple, intuitive icons for each accessibility profile to aid visual recognition.
